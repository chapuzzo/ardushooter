This is a library and a sketch, providing enhanced fetures to DSLR cameras such as:
* Better timer
* Intervalometer
* Sensor shooting (like microphone or flash/lightnings)
* HDR extreme bracketing

It includes a simple menu system for LCD screens, currently based on hd74LS48 compatible 16x2 [Arduino Shield](http://www.dx.com/p/118059). This menu library will be split appart when finished.
